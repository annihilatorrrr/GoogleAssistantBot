### **What is this bot for?**
This bot can manage your groups, it has custom filters against spammers and scammers and it's fully modular.

Most of the strings are in italian because we use it in italian telegram groups, but you can easily edit them in ```strings.ini``` and ```settings.ini```

### **Why we built it?**
We wonted something fully custom to integrate in our telegram community so we started developing on our own.
